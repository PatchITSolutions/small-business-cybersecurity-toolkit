# Password Best Practices for Small Businesses

## Protect Your Business with Strong Passwords

To keep your small business safe from cyber threats, follow these essential password best practices:

### 1. Choose Complex Passwords
- Use passwords that are at least 12 characters long and include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.

### 2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Add an extra layer of security with MFA to prevent unauthorized access.

### 3. Use a Password Manager
- Safely store and generate strong passwords with a reputable password manager.

### 4. Avoid Password Reuse
- Use unique passwords for each account to prevent a single breach from compromising multiple accounts.

### 5. Regularly Update Passwords
- Change passwords regularly, especially for critical systems and sensitive data.

### 6. Steer Clear of Common Words and Guessable Information
- Avoid using easily guessable information such as names, birthdays, or common words.

### 7. Use Passphrases for Better Security
- Utilize passphrases that are easy to remember but hard to guess for added security.

By following these best practices, you'll significantly reduce the risk of password-related security breaches and protect your small business's sensitive information.
