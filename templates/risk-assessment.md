# Detailed Risk Assessment Template

## 1. Introduction
- State the purpose of this risk assessment
- Define the scope of the assessment
- List key stakeholders involved in the assessment process

## 2. Asset Inventory
- List all critical assets (both physical and digital)
- Categorize assets (e.g., hardware, software, data, personnel)
- Assign value or importance to each asset

## 3. Threat Identification
- List potential threats to each asset
- Categorize threats (e.g., natural disasters, human errors, cyber attacks)
- Consider both internal and external threats

## 4. Vulnerability Assessment
- Identify vulnerabilities associated with each asset
- Consider technical, procedural, and human vulnerabilities
- Link vulnerabilities to specific threats where applicable

## 5. Current Controls
- List existing security controls for each asset
- Categorize controls (e.g., preventive, detective, corrective)
- Assess the effectiveness of current controls

## 6. Risk Evaluation Matrix
- Define likelihood and impact scales (e.g., Low, Medium, High)
- Create a risk matrix combining likelihood and impact
- Plot each risk on the matrix

## 7. Detailed Risk Analysis
For each identified risk:
- Describe the risk scenario
- Assess likelihood and potential impact
- Calculate risk score based on likelihood and impact
- Determine risk owner

## 8. Risk Treatment
For each risk:
- Decide on treatment approach (accept, mitigate, transfer, avoid)
- If mitigating, describe proposed additional controls
- Estimate residual risk after proposed controls

## 9. Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Prioritize risks for treatment
- Outline specific strategies for high-priority risks
- Consider cost-benefit analysis for proposed controls

## 10. Implementation Plan
- Create a timeline for implementing risk treatments
- Assign responsibilities for each action
- Define milestones and success criteria

## 11. Monitoring and Review Process
- Outline how risks will be monitored over time
- Define the frequency of reassessments
- Specify triggers for ad-hoc risk reviews

## 12. Approval and Sign-off
- Include sections for management review and approval
- Provide space for signatures and dates

## 13. Appendices
- Include any supporting documentation (e.g., detailed asset lists, threat intelligence reports)
- Add a glossary of terms used in the assessment

## 14. Revision History
- Track changes to the risk assessment over time
- Include dates and brief descriptions of updates
